# 48h challenge at Ynov Nantes

## what is the 48h challenge ? ##

the 48h Challenge is a challenge that last 48h. It takes place at Ynov Nantes Campus.
This year's subject was about creating an online marketplace to offer an alternative to Amazon and the likes, in order to offer to their clients a way to purchase and get their articles delivered. 
the goal was to set up a decentralised system that allow each merchant to keep their independency and apply their own economic policies.

## what were our goals ? ##
To achieve this, we had to setup a **Proof of Concept** (PoC) for the website, as well as a network of small servers that can host different versions of the website on each server, and communicate between each other. 
In short, a client would connect on the website, and be redirected towards a server. From this server, he is able to access every other instances of the website that are hosted to other servers. this is called a **Peer to Peer** (P2P) communication.

## which technical choices did we make for this ? ##
At first, we chose to make a first draft, using HTML, PHP and CSS to roughly see how the website should look like.
We used SQL to slowly build the database to stock all infos for each server separately.
